# flight-api_server

## Installation

```
npm install & bower install
```


## Static file server

A local installation of [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) provides a Node-based
foundation for running development and build tasks.

The watch task serves the contents of the 'app' directory on
`http://localhost:8080/`, and watches files for changes. Install Chrome's
[LiveReload extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei)
to have the browser tab automatically refresh when files are changed.

```
npm run watch
```

Alternatively, the server (which is a local installation of
[node-static](https://github.com/cloudhead/node-static/)) and can be run on its
own:

```
npm run server
```

Additional tasks can be included in the `gulpfile.js`. For further information
about using Gulp, please refer to the [Gulp website](http://gulpjs.com/).


## Unit tests

A local installation of Karma is used to run the JavaScript unit tests.
Karma makes it easy to watch files and run unit tests in real browsers:

```
npm run watch-test
```

This is the recommended approach because the moment your unit tests start
failing, you'll be notified in the terminal.

To run the unit tests just once in PhantomJS (for CI), you must install
PhantomJS and then run:

```
npm test
```

For further information about configuring Karma, please refer to the [Karma
website](http://karma-runner.github.io/).
